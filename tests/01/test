I am dissatisfied with the Wordpress.com code posting capabilities. All of the
possible solutions (using the included <code><code></code> tag or the included
<code>[code]</code>
plug-in or posting the entire html generated from the code via vim's TOhtml or
via highlight) were incomplete.
END
I wanted something which will allow me to write the post in a text file using
some syntax (Creole, Markdown, my own) for markup and with the ability to
introduce source code with a simple paste or some other markups. Afterward,
the tool will convert the entire file to an HTML which will be used to enter
the blog post into Wordpress blogs (right now, I don't care about other
platforms).
END
For this purpose, I created HaCoTeB. Even if it is in his infancy, the project
can be used to make simple posts like this one.
END
For example, the following code section lists the Main.hs file (yes, Ha from
the name means Haskell) of the project.
END
[c]
module Main where

import HaCoTeB

main = do
  s <- readFile "test"
  writeFile "test.html" $ representFileContent s
END
[t]
Because this post is short, I intend to give below the entire source file used
to generate it.

	As you can see, the sections are divided by a separator (think multipart HTTP
	responses) and their type is given by the first line of the section (if of the
	form [..]) or is implicit. What is written in the brackets is any prefix of the
	proper type, allowing for lazy typing :).
	END
	That's all. I will come up with a new version in a few more days, one which
	will have the basic text parsing capabilities (including proper highlighting
	of links and text formatting like bold or alignment).

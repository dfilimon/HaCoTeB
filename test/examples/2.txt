%text
This is a small example of paragraph typesetting for HaCoTeB. It supports
//italic// text, **bold** text and __underlined__ text (--stroked-out-- too).
However, the real output depends on the selected output printer. Thus, even if
you have an //italic text// it might end up as being displayed in **boldface**.

%text
**This is a bolded paragraph, every word here should be bold --and this part
should be stroked out-- while //this should be in italic// and __this
underlined__. __--//This part should have all of the attributes//--__.**

%text
Handling unmatched tags and not properly enclosed ones is not tested via this
file.

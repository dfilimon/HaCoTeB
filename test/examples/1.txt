This is a small example of the input file. It consists of three paragraphs,
separated by empty lines. Each paragraph has no decorations, thus, it is only a
simple text.

The text from each paragraph is plain text, no formatting elements are present.
Moreover, even if the text is breaked at 80 characters, the result will not
save this breaking.

The AST for this file will contain three nodes, each of them will contain the
text as a single line of text.
